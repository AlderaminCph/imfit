WARNING: This is primarily intended for personal use by PE within my local
copy of the repository; it is *not* a general guideline for building the
docs.

1. Update Markdown files; use BBEdit Markup->Preview to check on how it looks.

2. Generate rST versions of the Markdown files by running convert_md_to_rst.sh
script, then test the Sphinx HTML generatio by running Sphinx via the
Makefile

	$ ./convert_md_to_rst.sh && make html

View the resulting docs in a web browser pointed at 
	file:///Users/erwin/coding/imfit/docs/_build/html/index.html

If things look good, commit the changes to the Mercurial repo and pushd
to Github.
