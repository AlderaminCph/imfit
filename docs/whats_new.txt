NOTES FOR MAILING-LIST UPDATE, ETC.:

Just a short note to let people know that I've posted an updated version of imfit on
my web page (now at version 1.0b1 ...):
http://www.mpe.mpg.de/~erwin/code/imfit/

New things and changes as of 7 Feb 2013, compared to v0.9.9 [2 Jan 2013]:

MAJOR ADDITIONS:

* Imfit now includes an option (--cashstat) to use the Cash C statistic
(Cash 1979) instead of chi^2 as the "fit statistic" for the minimization; 
this is appropriate when the image noise statistics are pure Poisson (as 
true for most images when there is zero read noise), rather than Gaussian. (In
fact, some testing suggests this is better even when moderate Gaussian
read noise is present.)

The only drawback to using the Cash statistic is that it *cannot* be used with
the (default) Levenberg-Marquardt minimization algorithm, so you have to use the
Nelder-Mead simplex (--nm) or Differential Evolution (--de) instead. Also, you
cannot use it with separate error or variance map images (since those are for
the Gaussian-statistics case, which is what chi^2 is for).

* Bootstrap resampling for generating parameter error/confidence-interval estimates, 
via "--bootstrap N" [where N is the number of rounds of bootstrap resampling to do]
(Uses L-M for Gaussian/chi^2 case and N-M simplex for the Cash-statistic case.)


IMPORTANT FIXES:
* Corrections to calculation of per-pixel errors (in the chi^2 case); should be more 
correct for cases where sky was previously subtracted and the "--sky" argument is 
used to indicate the original background level. Previous fits may change slightly
as a result, though probably only at the 10^-3 or 10^-4 level in parameter values.


ADDITIONAL CHANGES:
* If the image you're fitting has been divided by the exposure time (so that the
pixel values are counts/sec), you can specify the original exposure time
with the "--exptime" option.

* The ExponentialDisk3D function uses sech^(2/n) for the vertical profile instead of 
a simple exponential (making it more like the analytic EdgeOnDisk function).

* The N-M simplex minimization algorithm now provides some minimal
feedback while doing the fit (prints current chi^2 or Cash statistic
value every 20 function calls, where "function call" = generating model
image and computing chi^2 or Cash statistic)

* Minor speedups to Differential Evolution fitting when one or more
parameters are fixed.

Just a short note to let people know that I've posted an updated version of imfit on
my web page (now at version 0.9.9 ...):
http://www.mpe.mpg.de/~erwin/code/imfit/

Changes include:
	command-line switch to limit the number of CPU threads used [*];
	command-line switch to specify the chi^2 tolerance for fitting;
	an additional nonlinear fitting algorithm (Nelder-Mead simplex, which is slower
than Levenberg-Marquardt but less likely to be trapped in local minima in the chi^2
landscape; faster than Differential Evolution) 
	lowered default chi^2 tolerance (speeds up fits slightly; trivial changes to final
best-fit solutions in some cases, but much smaller than errors)

I'm having problems with the 32-bit Linux installation on my virtual machine, so the
updated binaries are just the Mac OS X and 64-bit Linux ones at the moment.

Subject: Updated version of imfit (0.95)

You're getting this email because you've used (or expressed an interest in) my 2D
image-fitting program. There's an updated version available (which handles the edges
of images when doing PSF convolution) at the usual place:
