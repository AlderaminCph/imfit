NOTES FOR MAILING-LIST UPDATE, ETC.:

New things and changes as of 14 Jan 2013, compared to v0.9.9 [2 Jan 2013]:

MAJOR ADDITIONS:
Cash statistic [requires N-M or DE]

Bootstrap resampling for error estimation
(Uses L-M for Gaussian/chi^2 case and N-M simplex for 

IMPORTANT FIXES:
Corrections to calculation of per-pixel errors; should be more correct for
cases where sky was previously subtracted and the "--sky" argument is used to
indicate the original background level. Previous fits may change slightly
as a result, though probably only at the 10^-3 or 10^-4 level in parameter values.

ADDITIONAL CHANGES:
--exptime

ExponentialDisk3D uses sech^(2/n) for vertical profile instead of exponential

N-M simplex model now provides minimal feedback while doing the fit (prints
current chi^2 every 20 function calls, where "function call" = generating
model image and computing chi^2 or Cash statistic)

Minor speedup to Differential Evolution fitting when one or more parameters are fixed.

Email sent out on 2 Jan 2013:

Just a short note to let people know that I've posted an updated version of imfit on
my web page (now at version 0.9.9 ...):
http://www.mpe.mpg.de/~erwin/code/imfit/

Changes include:
	command-line switch to limit the number of CPU threads used [*];
	command-line switch to specify the chi^2 tolerance for fitting;
	an additional nonlinear fitting algorithm (Nelder-Mead simplex, which is slower
than Levenberg-Marquardt but less likely to be trapped in local minima in the chi^2
landscape; faster than Differential Evolution) 
	lowered default chi^2 tolerance (speeds up fits slightly; trivial changes to final
best-fit solutions in some cases, but much smaller than errors)

[*] As originally requested by Martin Kuemmel


I'm having problems with the 32-bit Linux installation on my virtual machine, so the
updated binaries are just the Mac OS X and 64-bit Linux ones at the moment.

Subject: Updated version of imfit (0.95)

You're getting this email because you've used (or expressed an interest in) my 2D
image-fitting program. There's an updated version available (which handles the edges
of images when doing PSF convolution) at the usual place:
