** NEAR-TERM FUTURE TOD0:

[..] New class encapsulating return metadata from minimizers (like mp_results, but
for all minimizers)


[..] King model FunctionObject
	-- function_objects/func_king.h/cpp : in progress
	-- need to set up some profile-computation tests (e.g., compare 1-D slices
	through output image with 1-D profiles generated by ...?)
		[x] Write Python code to implement function; test by generating plot
		with same ranges as Fig.10 of Peng+2010 and comparing (overlay in Illustrator?)
		[x] Generate plot with all profiles
		[x] Compare plot with Fig.10 of Peng+2010 in Illustrator
	-- check that we get I= 0 for r > r_t; possibly introduce shortcut in code
	to just return 0 in that case.


[] Modify handling of oversampled PSF to catch case where user wants entire
image oversampled
	-- e.g., if total number of pixels in main + oversampled region (model images,
	including edge-padding for PSF) > number of pixels in hypothetical oversampling
	of entire image ==> switch to oversampling of entire image

	-- need to test this to make sure time spent isn't wrongly estimated (e.g.,
	actual time with oversampling includes FFT + downsampling)


[] Oversampling of multiple sub-regions (possibly with their own oversampled PSFs)


[] Optional convolution with charge-diffusion kernel?


[] Test generation (and saving?) of FFTW plans
	-- might require making a cloned repo




** MINOR BUGS TO FIX/IMPROVEMENTS TO MAKE:



* FIXED

[X] --quiet option with Nelder-Mead simplex (--nm) is not truly quiet (some of N-M
simplex output is suppressed, but "iteration XXX" is still printed)
	-- OK, this is a difference between the current version of NLopt library ints
	dynamic form (what we normally use) and the static-linking one

[X] Compiling with our SCons option --no-nlopt fails to catch references to NLopt
function NMSimplexFit in bootstrap_errors.cpp
	Reported by Guillermo Barro
	-- FIX: add preprocessor directives to comment out all references to NLopt stuff
