Let ModelObject handle supplying PSF images to PointSource functions?
	-- ModelObject generates psfInterpolator object, passes pointer to that
	into individual PointSource functions
	-- C++11 weak pointer?


Alternate interpolation
	-- Lanczos looks simple enough to implement directly
	-- Make PointSource have an optional parameter which specifies e.g.
	bicubic spline vs Lanczos2 vs Lanczos3?
		[] Write Python code to implement 1D Lanczos interpolation
		[] Write Python code to implement 2D Lanczos interpolation


Future options:
	[] How to handle PSF oversampling regions?
		-- want to make sure we don't accidentally overwrite a PointSource
		with an oversampled region
		-- PointSource with two PSF images?
			Optional boolean-setting method for FunctionObject: doing oversampled
			region
			-- Ensure internal flag is reset to false when Setup() is called;
			new method should be called *after* Setup if we're doing oversampling
		-- Problem: each oversampling region has its own (possibly unique) oversampled
		PSF
		
		-- How do we handle point sources with centers outside oversampling region
		but wings extending in to it?
		
		-- Very general possibility: PointSource can accept pointer to psfInterpolator
		object via special method (after Setup is called), so each OversampledRegion
		object can keep its own psfInterpolator object and pass it to the PointSource
		image function
			-- BUT: how do we take care of overall I_tot scaling?
			OK: psfInterpolator object should carry its own total-counts factor
		
	[] How does this interact with weird radio-interferometric PSFs (cf. Corentin
	Schreiber)? How do we scale those?
