MISCELLANEOUS TO-DO AND FIXES NEEDED FOR IMFIT:

(Bugs to fix, etc.; missing/desired features are in 
possible_2d_image-fitting_notes.txt)

[x] Bug in current version of imfit (after incorporating function-set-related
changes first implemented in 
	Run as: 
	$ ./imfit testimage_expdisk_tiny.fits --config smalltest_config_4.dat
	Problem traced to: weight vector is not set up properly: weight-vector
	values are all "nan"
	
	This appears to be a bug in the setup, in that previously we passed
	an error image, or provided specific gain and read-noise values.
	PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
		Because we did not specify a value for gain on the command line,
		the *uninitialized* value of options.gain [= 0] was passed to
		ModelObject.GenerateErrorVector, where it produced division-by-zero
		effects.

	FIXES:
		1. Specified default value of 1.0 for commandOptions.gain
		2. Inserted assert() statement at start of ModelObject.GenerateErrorVector,
		so that gain values <= 0 are trapped.


[] Fix PrintResult() in imfit_main.cpp to account for function sets with
common X0,Y0 values...
	[] Add PrintParameters function to ModelObject (which knows best about
	which functions have how many parameters, function-set boundaries, etc.)?


[] Determine whether or not func_sersic.cpp is calculating things
correctly (currently does not agree with astro_utils.Sersic at 10^-5
level).


[] Unit tests for Gaussian function object
