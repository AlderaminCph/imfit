Imfit
([http://www.mpe.mpg.de/~erwin/code/imfit/](http://www.mpe.mpg.de/~erwin/code/imfit/)) is an open-source program for fitting astronomical images
(primarily of galaxies). It is fast, flexible, and designed to be easily
extensible with new image-component functions.

Pre-compiled binaries for Linux and Mac OS X, along with documentation
and example files, can be found 
[at the main web page](http://www.mpe.mpg.de/~erwin/code/imfit/index.html#downloads),
as can a condensed subset of the main code.

A basic [tutorial](http://www.mpe.mpg.de/~erwin/code/imfit/markdown/index.html) is also available.

This Github site hosts the complete codebase, including extra tests and auxiliary
programs.
