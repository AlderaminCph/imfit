NOTES ON DEBUGGING (MAC OS X):

[] Core-dump peculiarities on Mac OS X:

1. By default, core dumps are turned *off* on Mac OS X; to enable them,
do this
$ ulimit -c unlimited

To turn core dumps back off:
$ ulimit -c 0


2. Core dumps do *not* go in the starting directory; instead, they all
go into /cores, with the PID appended to the name.  To tell which core
goes with which original process:
$ otool -c /cores/core.xxx
	where "xxx" = PID


[] Starting gdb on a core dump:
$ gdb -c core.47113
