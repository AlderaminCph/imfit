# This is a sample configuration file for imfit (it will also work with makeimage).
# Comments are introduced with the "#" character; anything following this character
# on the same line is ignored by imfit. Blank lines are also ignored.
# Note that to use this file with makeimage, the desired dimensions of the output
# model image will also need to be supplied.

# Optional image-description parameters for imfit and their default values;
# uncomment and edit if needed
GAIN            4.72   # A/D gain in e-/ADU
READNOISE       1.15   # read noise in electrons
ORIGINAL_SKY    124.94   # original background value (ADU/pixel) previously subtracted


# A single function block, containing a single image function;
# examples of optional lower and upper limits for each parameter value are in the 3rd column
X0   5.0    3,8     # pixel x-coordinate of function center
Y0   6.0    3,8     # pixel y-coordinate of function center
